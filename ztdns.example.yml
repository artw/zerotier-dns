# Mappings between subdomains and ZeroTier network IDs.  Only one of "network"

  # E.g., if there is a network with ID "123abc" this would map its members to
  # "<member name>.home.zt":
  #   home: "123abc"

# Mappings between round-robin names and regexps to match members.  Names are
# matched within each network (i.e., if there are members matching a mapping in
# multiple networks then the name will be defined separately in each).
round-robin:
  # E.g., if the "home" network defined above had members "k8s-node-23refw" and
  # "k8s-node-09sf8g" this would create a name "k8s-nodes.home.zt" returning one
  # of them at random:
  #   k8s-nodes: "k8s-node-\w"
