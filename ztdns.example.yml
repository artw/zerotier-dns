# Mappings between round-robin names and regexps to match members.  Names are
# matched within each network (i.e., if there are members matching a mapping in

round-robin:
  # E.g., if the "home" network defined above had members "k8s-node-23refw" and
  # "k8s-node-09sf8g" this would create a name "k8s-nodes" returning one of them
  # at random.
  # k8s-nodes: "k8s-node-\w"
